# Spam-detector-with-WORD2VEC
This project is focused on building a sentiment analysis model using Word2Vec embeddings and machine learning classifiers. The model predicts whether a given message is positive (ham) or negative (spam), utilizing natural language processing (NLP) techniques and leveraging pre-trained word embeddings for feature extraction.
